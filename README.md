# js-oop
This is a simple "to do" app written with vanilla JavaScript that aims to demonstrate some concepts for modular development, like object (classes and instantiation) and event orientation.

## How it works?
Just download the ```.zip``` or clone the repo and open the ```index.html``` file into your browser.

## Why?

### JS for Java developers
I saw many graduated developers take class after class of OOP using Java, but when they sit to write JavaScript, the concepts they learned in college are simply ignored. All of them tend to create a single file - like "template.js" - and put the entire JS code there. So, I decided to write this to show how you can achieve a "Java like" code structure with vanilla JavaScript.

### I love jQuery, but learn dosn't hurt
Another need for this, is the huge amount of developers that learned "jQuery before JavaScipt".

I know that the JS community have been writing the death note of jQuery for a few years now, but the number of people who use it and still didn't get your hands dirty in the awesome world of "true JavaScript" is huge. So, I hope this helps some of them to see that the concepts behind jQuery are not that complex and their lifes dosn't depend on it.
